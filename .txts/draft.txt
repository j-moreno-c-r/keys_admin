something like: 
1: sha256 hash to verificate and free the acesss;
2: PGP encryption the keys:
    somethinglike:
        1: A public and private key seeding headers to him self
        2: headers on sub files
        3: dict with the names of the sites in a main.txt
        4: and the paths to the files....

    and more important i need random generator keys...
